**Project Title**: **Music Recommendation System Using Spark and Collaborative Filtering**

---

**Project Description**:  
This project implements a **Music Recommendation System** leveraging **Apache Spark** for large-scale data processing and **Collaborative Filtering** for generating personalized song recommendations. The system processes user-song interaction data to train a recommendation model, evaluates its performance, and generates tailored song recommendations for users. The project follows best practices in software engineering, including modular code design, logging, and scalability.

**Key Features**:

1. **Dataset Handling**:  
   - Downloads the MovieLens dataset from a specified URL.
   - Extracts the dataset from a compressed ZIP file for preprocessing.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Loads user-song interaction data and song metadata using PySpark.
   - Cleans and preprocesses the data, including joining datasets to enrich song metadata with user ratings.

3. **Collaborative Filtering Model**:  
   - Implements the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm for collaborative filtering.
   - Splits data into training and testing sets for robust model evaluation.
   - Evaluates model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

4. **Song Recommendation Generation**:  
   - Generates personalized song recommendations for all users.
   - Utilizes Spark's `recommendForAllUsers` function to create a ranked list of recommendations.
   - Outputs recommendations in a structured CSV format for further analysis or deployment.

5. **Scalability and Flexibility**:  
   - Built on Apache Spark to handle large datasets efficiently.
   - Modular design allows easy customization for different datasets or additional features.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Big Data Framework**: Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- **Machine Learning Library**: Spark MLlib  
- **Data Storage**: CSV Files  
- **Utilities**: Requests (for downloading datasets), ZipFile (for data extraction), Logging, and Python's CSV module.

**Steps to Run the System**:
1. Define the dataset URL, download path, and extraction path.
2. Instantiate the `MusicRecommendationModel` class with these parameters.
3. Run the system using the `run` method to perform all steps, from downloading the dataset to generating recommendations.

**Outputs**:  
- **Trained Model**: ALS-based collaborative filtering model.  
- **Evaluation Metric**: RMSE for model accuracy assessment.  
- **Recommendations**: A CSV file (`recommended_songs.csv`) containing user-song recommendations with predicted ratings.

**Use Case**:  
This system is designed for music streaming platforms to enhance user experience by providing tailored song recommendations. It can be adapted to other domains like movie, book, or product recommendations by substituting appropriate datasets.
